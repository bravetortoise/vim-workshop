# Getting Started with Vim

### Steven Kneiser's notes for his [Spartan Hackers](http://spartanhackers.com/)

```

Also if you want to get the most out of the talk then I strongly urge you to get ahead by taking an hour to go through or at very least start a basics tutorial. On most unix systems you should actually be able to do that by running this simple command in the tutorial:

```shell
vimtutor
```

*See you at the talk!*
